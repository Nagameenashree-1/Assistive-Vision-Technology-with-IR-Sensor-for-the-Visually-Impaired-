IR Sensor-Based Smart Glass for the Visually Impaired

This project is a cost-effective, compact assistive technology designed to help visually impaired individuals detect nearby obstacles using IR sensors. It generates real-time alerts via sound or vibration to guide safe navigation.

üìå Features

- IR sensor-based obstacle detection
- No microcontroller/Arduino used ‚Äì fully hardware-based
- Real-time alert via buzzer or vibration motor
- Compact and wearable design (integrated into glasses)
- Low-power operation with rechargeable battery

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. IR sensor emits infrared light.
2. If an obstacle is nearby, reflected IR light is detected.
3. The analog signal is processed by a comparator or NE555 circuit.
4. Based on proximity, a buzzer or vibration motor is triggered to alert the user.

üìù How to Build

1. Connect IR sensor output to comparator or NE555 IC.
2. Connect output to buzzer or vibration motor.
3. Power the system using a small Li-Po battery.
4. Mount components on a spectacle frame.
5. Turn on the switch and test the detection.
